# DiplomaS1-RPG-Project
A Pokemon clone RPG done in a few months for Diploma of Software Development Stage 1.

# Features
Mostly just the battle system with an overworld test area containing some wild encounters and one trainer NPC.  
Also a debug menu to set up custom battles between whichever 2 monsters you like.

Battle system is functional and works, though items and switching to different monsters is not implemented.  
Most other things work - Status effects, critical hits, accuracy, type effectiveness, etc.

# Assets
Assets are all free ones from the Unity Asset Store.

# Plans
I stopped working on this to focus on Stage 2 of my Diploma, and kind of forgot about it afterwards.  
I may come back to it at some point, as it was a fun project to work on and there are a lot of things left unimplemented - And plenty more that could have been implemented better.
