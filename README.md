# DiplomaS1-RPG-Project
A Pokemon clone RPG done in a few months for Diploma of Software Development Stage 1.

# Features
Mostly just the battle system with an overworld test area containing some wild encounters and one trainer NPC.  
Also a debug menu to set up custom battles between whichever 2 monsters you like.

Battle system is functional and works, though items and switching to different monsters is not implemented.  
Most other things work - Status effects, critical hits, accuracy, type effectiveness, etc.

# Assets
Most assets are free ones from the Unity Asset Store, and are in the 3rdPartyAssets in individual folders if you are curious where they're from.  
Other than the 3rd party ones the only self made ones were for the cries of the monsters which were done (poorly) by me in my microphone with Audacity.

# Plans
I stopped working on this to focus on Stage 2 of my Diploma, and kind of forgot about it afterwards.  
I may come back to it at some point, as it was a fun project to work on and there are a lot of things left unimplemented - And plenty more that could have been implemented better.
